### ***Hi there!***
  
I am currently an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at the University of San Carlos. Currently extending my skills beyond academic projects into impactful contributions, blending minimalistic design with user-focused solutions. Eager to collaborate and grow as I bring a creative yet structured approach to innovative projects.
